# ðŸ•’ CHANGELOG

## ðŸš€ v10 â€” Final Neural Network Model (May 25, 2025)

* âœ… Migrated from XGBoost to a Keras-based **neural network (MLP)**
* âœ… Used **Optuna** to tune hyperparameters over 100 trials
* âœ… Final architecture: 1 hidden layer, 256 units, `tanh` activation, slight dropout
* âœ… Trained only on **clean, realistic data** (no residual outliers, â‰¤2 missing values)
* âœ… Inputs normalized via `StandardScaler`
* âœ… All 7 features used and confirmed relevant via:

  * **SHAP analysis**
  * **Manual perturbation tests**
* âœ… Real-world anchor lap times (LFA, NSX) predicted accurately
* âœ… Fictional trap-heavy cars no longer overestimated â€” model generalizes well
* âœ… Saved as: `LapTimePredictor_MLP_v10_best.h5`

---

## âœ… v9 â€” Finalized XGBoost Model (May 25, 2025)

* âœ… Removed upstream features that caused redundancy or inflated importance:

  * Dropped: `Weight`, `Top Speed`, and `Drive Type`
  * Dropped engineered stats like `Composite Grip Index`, `Track Dominance Index`, and `Powerband Balance`
* âœ… Retained only raw inputs and one derived feature: `Acceleration Curve`
* âœ… Identified and removed cars with high prediction error (Z-score > 3) based on residual analysis
* âœ… Also removed cars with 3 or more missing input values to avoid over-reliance on imputation
* âœ… Retrained using Optuna (100 trials) and achieved best validation RMSE to date: **1.64 seconds**
* âœ… Manually validated outputs on edge cases to confirm model now:

  * Separates cars with realistic time gaps
  * No longer clusters different builds into identical lap times
  * Aligns with real-world benchmarks like the F40 LM
* âœ… Saved as: `LapTimePredictor_XGBoost_v9.json`
* âœ… Locked as **final production model**

## âœ… v8 â€” Trimmed Outliers (May 25, 2025)

* Trimmed dataset using lap time percentiles (5th to 95th)
* Retrained on cleaned data using Optuna tuning
* Improved generalization compared to v7

---

## âœ… v7 â€” Streamlined Feature Set (May 25, 2025)

* Removed `Horsepower`, `Weight`, `Drive Type`, and `Top Speed`
* Only retained meaningful acceleration, grip, and braking features
* Introduced monotone constraints and cleaned engineered stats down to 1 (`Acceleration Curve`)
* RMSE: \~1.75s

---

## âœ… v6 â€” Pre-Refactor Baseline

* Full feature set, included some redundant inputs
* Observed flat predictions and unrealistic clustering
* Used as the baseline for current refinement effort
